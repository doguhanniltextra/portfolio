                    The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to
                    evaluate architectures and implement designs that scale over time. This comprehensive guide covers
                    all six pillars and essential design principles for building robust cloud solutions.
                </p>

                <h2>The Six Pillars</h2>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Operational Excellence</h3>
                <p>
                    The ability to support development in delivering business value, run workloads effectively, gain
                    insights into operations, and continuously improve supporting processes and procedures.
                </p>

                <h3>Security</h3>
                <p>
                    Describes how to leverage cloud technologies to protect data, systems, and assets, and improve your
                    security posture.
                </p>

                <h3>Reliability</h3>
                <p>
                    The ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when it's
                    expected to.
                </p>

                <h3>Performance Efficiency</h3>
                <p>
                    The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that
                    efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
                </p>

                <h3>Cost Optimization</h3>
                <p>
                    The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.
                </p>

                <h3>Sustainability</h3>
                <p>
                    The ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and
                    increasing efficiency across all components of a workload, maximizing the benefits from the
                    provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.
                </p>

                <h2>General Design Principles</h2>

                <div class="architecture-list">
                    <div class="service-item">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Stop Guessing Your Capacity Needs</h4>
                        <p>With cloud computing, you can use as much or as little capacity as you need and scale up and
                            down automatically, eliminating expensive idle resources or performance issues from
                            insufficient capacity.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="service-item">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-vial"></i> Test Systems at Production Scale</h4>
                        <p>Create a production-scale test environment on demand, complete your testing, and then shut
                            down the resources. You only pay for the test environment when it's running.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="service-item">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-robot"></i> Automate with Architectural Experimentation in Mind</h4>
                        <p>Automation allows you to create and replicate workloads at low cost, track changes, audit
                            impacts, and revert to previous parameters when necessary.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="service-item">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> Consider Evolutionary Architectures</h4>
                        <p>The cloud enables systems to evolve over time through on-demand automation and testing,
                            allowing businesses to benefit from innovations as a standard practice.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="service-item">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-database"></i> Drive Architectures Using Data</h4>
                        <p>Collect data on how architectural choices affect workload behavior to make fact-based
                            decisions. Your cloud infrastructure is code, so use data to inform improvements over time.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="service-item">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-gamepad"></i> Improve Through Game Days</h4>
                        <p>Regularly schedule Game Days to test architecture and processes by simulating production
                            events, helping identify improvements and build organizational experience.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Architecture Team Roles</h2>
                <p>
                    Technology architecture teams typically include a range of roles such as <strong>Technical
                        Architect</strong> (infrastructure), <strong>Solution Architect</strong> (software),
                    <strong>Data Architect</strong>, <strong>Network Architect</strong>, and <strong>Security
                        Architect</strong>. These teams often utilize TOGAF or similar architectural capability
                    frameworks.
                </p>

                <h2>Governance and Compliance</h2>

                <div class="callout callout-info">
                    <strong>💡 Key Insight:</strong> Validate that you have mechanisms to identify changes to internal
                    governance and external compliance requirements.
                </div>

                <p>There are two different rule-makers to monitor:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Internal Governance:</strong> Your organization's own policies, standards, and best
                        practices</li>
                    <li><strong>External Compliance:</strong> Regulatory requirements, industry standards, and legal
                        obligations</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Monitoring vs Observability</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Monitoring</strong> is tracking known issues (Known-Unknowns). You open a dashboard and say
                    "notify me if CPU exceeds 90%". The answer is either yes or no.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Observability</strong>, on the other hand, is the ability to debug unknown issues
                    (Unknown-Unknowns). The system can tell you that CPU is high because microservice X is sending too
                    many queries to database Y, and 30% of these queries are creating deadlocks.
                </p>

                <h3>The Three Pillars of Observability</h3>
                <div class="architecture-list">
                    <div class="service-item">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-chart-bar"></i> Metrics</h4>
                        <p>Numerical data stored as time-series</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="service-item">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Logs</h4>
                        <p>Text records of what happened at a specific moment</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="service-item">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-route"></i> Traces</h4>
                        <p>The journey of a request through the system</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Runbook vs Playbook</h2>

                <div class="callout callout-warning">
                    <strong>⚠️ Important Distinction:</strong> Use established runbooks for well-understood events, and
                    use playbooks to aid in investigation.
                </div>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Runbook:</strong> Like a recipe - the outcome is known. If you can write a runbook for
                        something (step-by-step instructions are clear), ideally it should be a bash script or AWS
                        Systems Manager Automation document.</li>
                    <li><strong>Playbook:</strong> The outcome is uncertain. It's more of a guide than a solution,
                        helping with investigation rather than providing definitive answers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

                <h3>The Customer Support Dilemma</h3>
                <p>
                    When a customer comes with an issue like "I can't open my account", one solution is to build an
                    interface for support staff. However, developing, maintaining, and securing this interface creates
                    its own ecosystem with hidden and significant costs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alternatively, approaches like banning SSH, using VPN/Private Link instead of Bastion Hosts are
                    examples of the principle of <strong>protecting developers from themselves</strong>.
                </p>

                <h3>AWS Identity Types</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Human Identities:</strong> Your administrators, developers, operators, and end users
                        require an identity to access your AWS environments and applications</li>
                    <li><strong>Machine Identities:</strong> Your service applications, operational tools, and workloads
                        require an identity to make requests to AWS services</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Threat Modeling</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Threat Modeling</strong> means thinking "How would a hacker break this system?" before
                    writing any code.
                </p>

                <p>In the Backend/Cloud world, this is represented by the <strong>STRIDE</strong> model:</p>

                <h2>Storage Types in AWS</h2>

                <h3>Object Storage (Amazon S3)</h3>
                <p>
                    Object storage makes data accessible from any internet location. In S3, there are no files or
                    folders - there are <strong>Objects</strong>. Each object has a <strong>Key</strong> and a
                    <strong>Value</strong>. Access is via REST API.
                </p>
                <div class="callout callout-warning">
                    <strong>⚠️ Limitation:</strong> Write Once, Read Many - You cannot change 1 byte in the middle of a
                    file; you must re-upload the entire file. This is why you cannot run a database on S3.
                </div>

                <h3>Block Storage (Amazon EBS)</h3>
                <p>
                    Block storage is like the SSD you attach to a computer. It's raw disk space. The operating system
                    formats it and installs a file system, reading or writing data in small blocks. Access protocol is
                    direct I/O. It can only be attached to a single EC2 instance.
                </p>

                <h3>File Storage (Amazon EFS / FSx)</h3>
                <p>
                    Classic folder tree structure. Access protocol is NFS for Linux or SMB for Windows. Multiple EC2
                    instances can mount this disk simultaneously and read/write to the same file.
                </p>

                <h2>Blame-Free Culture</h2>

                <div class="callout callout-success">
                    <strong>✅ Best Practice:</strong> A blame-free approach that encourages diving deep into issues
                    without fear of punishment.
                </div>

                <p>
                    In theory, if an error causes the system to crash, the culprit is not person X, but the process that
                    allowed person X to make that error. This is called <strong>Psychological Safety</strong>. The goal
                    is to ensure people don't hide their mistakes.
                </p>

                <p>This approach encourages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open discussion of failures</li>
                    <li>Learning from mistakes</li>
                    <li>Improving processes rather than punishing individuals</li>
                    <li>Building trust within teams</li>
                    <li>Creating an environment where innovation can thrive</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides a comprehensive foundation for building secure,
                    high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for applications. By understanding and
                    implementing these six pillars and design principles, organizations can make informed decisions
                    about their cloud architectures and continuously improve their systems over time.
