                <p class="lead">
                    When it comes to measuring how fast your system is, the average latency is almost always a lie.
                    P95 latency tells you a much more honest (and scarier) story.
                </p>

                <h2>1. What Does "Latency" Even Mean?</h2>

                <p>
                    Latency is the time it takes for your system to respond to a single request, measured from when the client
                    sends it to when it receives the response. Think of it as round-trip time for a single API call.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When you have thousands of requests per second, latency isn't a single number. It's a
                    <strong>distribution</strong>. Some requests are fast. Some are slow. And a few are painfully slow.
                    To understand this distribution, we use <strong>percentiles</strong>.
                </p>

                <h2>2. What Is P95 Latency?</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>P95 (95th percentile) latency</strong> is the maximum latency experienced by 95% of your
                    requests when all requests are sorted from fastest to slowest. In other words:
                </p>

                <div class="callout callout-info">
                    <strong>Simple Definition:</strong> If your P95 latency is 200ms, it means 95 out of every 100
                    requests completed in <em>200ms or less</em>. The remaining 5% took longer than 200ms.
                </div>

                <p>
                    Let's say you get 1,000 requests. Sort them all by response time, from fastest to slowest.
                    Point to request number 950. The response time at that position is your P95 latency.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Why Not Just Use the Average?</h2>

                <p>
                    The average is dangerously misleading. Here's a simple example. Imagine 10 requests with these
                    response times (in milliseconds):
                </p>

                <pre><code class="language-bash">10, 12, 11, 13, 10, 11, 12, 10, 11, 500</code></pre>

                <p>
                    The <strong>average</strong> is about 59ms. That sounds reasonable. But 9 out of 10 of those
                    requests finished in around 11ms. One request took 500ms, a full half-second. That one slow
                    request is a real user sitting there waiting. The average hides it completely.
                </p>

                <div class="callout callout-warning">
                    <strong>The Problem with Averages:</strong> A single extremely slow request (an "outlier") can
                    skew your average in a way that masks serious performance issues. Percentiles don't lie like this.
                </div>

                <h2>4. The Percentile Family</h2>

                <p>
                    P95 isn't the only percentile worth knowing. Here's the full picture:
                </p>

                <div class="architecture-list">
                    <div class="service-item">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i> P50 (Median)</h4>
                        <p>Half of your requests are faster than this, half are slower. This is the "typical" user
                            experience. A good baseline to track.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="service-item">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> P95</h4>
                        <p>95% of requests complete within this time. This is the most commonly used SLO (Service Level
                            Objective) threshold because it captures the experience of nearly all users while ignoring
                            extreme edge cases.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="service-item">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> P99</h4>
                        <p>99% of requests complete within this time. Useful for high-stakes systems (payments, auth)
                            where even rare slowness is unacceptable.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="service-item">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-skull"></i> P99.9 (The "Nines")</h4>
                        <p>Only 1 in 1,000 requests can be slower than this. Used in ultra-reliable systems where
                            tail latency directly impacts revenue or safety.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>5. A Real-World Example</h2>

                <p>
                    Suppose your API serves 10,000 requests per minute. Your monitoring dashboard shows:
                </p>

                <pre><code class="language-bash">P50:  18ms
P95:  200ms
P99:  850ms</code></pre>

                <p>
                    What does this tell you?
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>typical user</strong> gets a response in 18ms. That's great.</li>
                    <li>But <strong>500 users per minute</strong> (5% of 10,000) are waiting 200ms or more.</li>
                    <li>And <strong>100 users per minute</strong> (1%) are stuck waiting 850ms or more, nearly a full
                        second. That's a bad experience for real people.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="callout callout-info">
                    <strong>Key Insight:</strong> At scale, your tail latency (P95, P99) affects thousands of real
                    users, not just theoretical edge cases. A 1% problem with 1,000,000 daily users is 10,000 people
                    having a bad day.
                </div>

                <h2>6. What Causes High Tail Latency?</h2>

                <p>
                    Tail latency spikes can come from many places:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Garbage Collection pauses:</strong> JVM-based services (Java, Kotlin) frequently
                        experience GC pauses that stall a single request while memory is reclaimed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Database lock contention:</strong> When many requests compete for the same row or
                        table lock, some must wait their turn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network jitter:</strong> Temporary packet loss or retransmissions in the underlying
                        network layer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cold starts:</strong> Serverless functions or auto-scaled containers that haven't
                        warmed up yet respond much slower on first invocation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource exhaustion:</strong> Thread pools, connection pools, or CPU being saturated
                        under high load causes queuing delays.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>7. How to Use P95 in Practice</h2>

                <p>
                    P95 latency is most useful when you tie it to an <strong>SLO (Service Level Objective)</strong>. An
                    SLO is simply a promise you make about your system's behavior. For example:
                </p>

                <pre><code class="language-bash"># Example SLO Definition
"99% of all API requests will complete within 300ms (P99 ≤ 300ms)"
"95% of payment transactions will complete within 500ms (P95 ≤ 500ms)"</code></pre>

                <p>
                    Once you define your SLOs, you can set up <strong>alerts</strong> in your monitoring tool
                    (Prometheus, Datadog, Grafana) to notify you the moment your P95 crosses the threshold. This is
                    far more actionable than "average latency went up a bit."
                </p>

                <div class="feature-grid">
                    <div class="feature-box">
                        <i class="fas fa-bell"></i>
                        <h4>Alert on P95</h4>
                        <p>Set your alerting thresholds on percentiles, not averages. This catches real user pain
                            before it becomes an outage.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature-box">
                        <i class="fas fa-tachometer-alt"></i>
                        <h4>Track Trends</h4>
                        <p>Watch how P95 changes over time and across deployments. A rising P95 after a deploy is a
                            clear signal of a regression.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature-box">
                        <i class="fas fa-layer-group"></i>
                        <h4>Segment by Endpoint</h4>
                        <p>Don't just track overall P95. Break it down by endpoint. A single slow route can drag
                            your whole service's numbers up.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>8. Quick Summary</h2>

                <div class="callout callout-info">
                    <strong>The One-Paragraph Version:</strong><br><br>
                    P95 latency is the response time that 95% of your requests fall under. If your P95 is 200ms,
                    then 95 out of every 100 requests finished in 200ms or less, and 5 didn't. The remaining 5%
                    are your "tail": real users experiencing slowness that averages would never reveal. Tracking
                    P95 (and P99) gives you honest visibility into your system's worst-case behavior, which is
                    exactly where performance problems hurt users most.
