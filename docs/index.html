                            <ul>
                                <li>I chose a microservice architecture to achieve loose coupling, scalability, and
                                    independent deployments. Each service is responsible for a specific domain
                                    (patients, doctors, appointments, billing, authentication), which makes the system
                                    modular and easier to maintain. This design also allows services to use different
                                    databases and technologies depending on their requirements, rather than being
                                    restricted to a single stack. In addition, microservices enable fault isolation — if
                                    one service fails, the others can continue functioning, improving the system’s
                                    reliability</li>
                                <li>Each microservice has its own database to respect the loose coupling principle. I
                                    used PostgreSQL for the Patient Service because of its powerful relational features,
                                    JSONB support, and advanced querying capabilities, which fit patient data well. On
                                    the other hand, I chose MySQL for the Doctor Service since it is lightweight and
                                    efficient for handling structured data with high read/write operations.</li>
                                <li>I used Apache Kafka for asynchronous, event-driven communication between services.
                                    Instead of relying only on HTTP calls, Kafka enabled me to build a scalable and
                                    fault-tolerant data pipeline. Producers generate events (such as patient updates or
                                    logs), and consumers process them independently, which reduces coupling and improves
                                    system resilience./li>
                                <li>Docker allowed me to containerize services and databases, ensuring they run
                                    consistently across environments. Volumes were used to persist user data. Kubernetes
                                    provided orchestration features such as service discovery, load balancing, scaling,
                                    and persistent storage management, making deployments production-ready and easier to
                                    maintain.</li>
                                <li>I implemented an API Gateway to act as the single entry point for all requests. This
                                    simplified routing, authentication, and abstraction, since clients do not need to
                                    know individual service endpoints. It also centralized security and cross-cutting
                                    concerns like logging and request filtering, improving both usability and
                                    maintainability.</li>
                                <li>I set up GitHub Actions to automate build, test, and deployment pipelines. This
                                    reduced deployment time to under 15 minutes and ensured multi-platform Docker images
                                    could be pushed and deployed to cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure). The CI/CD
                                    pipeline improved reliability, minimized human error, and made the project more
                                    production-ready.</li>

                                <li>The Online Course Management Platform is a comprehensive educational management
                                    system where users can easily manage courses, enroll, and track their learning
                                    progress. The platform supports secure user registration and login with JWT-based
                                    authentication and Spring Security, ensuring role-based access control for Students,
                                    Instructors, and Admins. Students can browse and enroll in courses, Instructors can
                                    create, edit, and delete courses and lessons, while Admins oversee user management,
                                    course approvals, and platform-wide activities.</li>
                                <li>Performance and user experience optimizations include lazy loading and critical
                                    service optimization, reducing page load times by approximately three seconds. Redis
                                    caching has been implemented to accelerate popular queries and reduce database load.
                                    A course recommendation system uses TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity algorithms to
                                    provide personalized suggestions for students. Additionally, a gamification system
                                    rewards users with points and badges when they reach specific milestones.</li>
                                <li>The platform offers a secure course purchase system integrated with Stripe or
                                    PayPal. Students can buy courses, unlock full access, and receive receipts for
                                    completed transactions. Course management features allow Instructors to add lessons
                                    with content and optional video URLs, and students can search, filter, and paginate
                                    through available courses efficiently. The system also supports tracking course
                                    completion, lesson progress, and course ratings and reviews to help other learners
                                    make informed decisions.</li>
                                <li>A forum feature enhances interaction between students and instructors. Students can
                                    post questions, receive answers, like and comment on responses, and participate in
                                    community-driven discussions. Instructors have moderation capabilities to ensure a
                                    respectful and productive environment, while notifications keep users informed about
                                    course updates, enrollments, and important platform events.</li>
                                <li>The platform is built using Spring Boot for backend services and supports relational
                                    databases such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, with optional MongoDB. Docker is used for
                                    containerization and deployment, while Redis enhances performance through caching.
                                    Automated testing ensures reliability, including tests for lesson and course
                                    creation, updates, deletion, recommendation algorithms, gamification, email
                                    services, search functionality, and admin management, verifying that all core
                                    features function correctly and securely.</li>

                                    service responsible for a specific domain and operating independently. Key services
                                    include the Category Service for managing categories, Product Service for handling
                                    product data and inventory, Order Service for processing and tracking orders, Upload
                                    Service for managing images and media, and User Service for authentication, roles,
                                    and permissions. MongoDB is used as the primary database for all services, while JWT
                                    ensures secure communication and authorization.</li>
                                <li>The frontend is built using React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and leverages Redux
                                    Toolkit (RTK) for state management. RTK is chosen for its simplified configuration,
                                    improved performance, enhanced readability, and built-in best practices for scalable
                                    Redux code. The frontend communicates with the backend microservices via RESTful
                                    APIs, allowing a smooth and dynamic user experience.</li>

                                <li>GloriousFood is a modern food ordering mobile application built with React Native,
                                    designed to allow users to easily manage their food orders and securely store credit
                                    card information. The app provides a clean and visually appealing interface with
                                    purple-themed styling, enhancing the user experience while making navigation
                                    intuitive. Key features include order management, secure card storage, and JWT-based
                                    user session management for authentication and secure logout.</li>
                                <li>The app’s frontend leverages Redux for state management, ensuring smooth handling of
                                    order data, selected restaurants, and payment information. AsyncStorage is used for
                                    persistent local storage of user data, while React Native Credit Card Input collects
                                    and validates card information securely. The application includes modular components
                                    such as a dynamic search bar, home page with categories and featured offers, and
                                    detailed restaurant pages for a seamless browsing and ordering experience.</li>
                                <li>On the backend, Node.js with Express and Mongoose is used to handle authentication,
                                    user management, and order processing. JWT provides secure session management, while
                                    MongoDB stores all application data. The backend supports features such as order
                                    creation, increment/decrement of items, deletion of orders, and tracking total
                                    payment amounts. Security is enhanced with bcryptjs for password hashing and
                                    environment variables for configuration management.</li>
                                <li>GloriousFood integrates a fully functional payment workflow using Redux for frontend
                                    state and JWT for secure authentication. Users can view selected orders, track total
                                    costs, and clear payment data when needed. Conditional rendering ensures the order
                                    icon is only displayed when items are selected. Login validation prevents
                                    unauthorized access to sensitive pages, such as Orders, Payments, or Order History,
                                    ensuring that only authenticated users can interact with core features.</li>

                                <li>Finding the Disease Based on Symptoms is an innovative AI-powered healthcare
                                    application designed to assist users in identifying potential diseases or health
                                    conditions based on their reported symptoms. The system provides a preliminary
                                    screening tool that encourages users to seek professional medical advice when
                                    necessary. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and natural language
                                    processing techniques, the application delivers a convenient and accessible way for
                                    individuals to gain early insights into their health.</li>
                                <li>The project is built using Streamlit for a modern and interactive user interface,
                                    replacing the older Flask-based version. Key upgrades include the integration of
                                    TF-IDF for text analysis, a HuggingFace Question-Answer system for intelligent
                                    responses, and a patient profile side selection for personalized assessments.
                                    Additionally, a Symptom Weight Visualizer helps users understand the potential
                                    impact of specific symptoms on their health within two days. Code optimizations have
                                    reduced app startup time to approximately 8.2 seconds, improving user experience.
                                </li>
                                <li>For disease prediction, the project employs a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier,
                                    achieving an accuracy range of 72% to 85%. Multiple datasets from Kaggle were used
                                    for training and validation, providing a robust foundation for symptom-based
                                    classification. While the model is capable of reasonably accurate predictions,
                                    results are intended as informative guidelines rather than definitive medical
                                    diagnoses. Users are reminded that professional consultation is essential for
                                    conclusive evaluation.</li>
                                <li>The system offers several benefits, including increased accessibility, early
                                    awareness of potential health issues, and the promotion of public health through
                                    timely intervention. Users can perform preliminary assessments from home or
                                    on-the-go, encouraging proactive health management. However, limitations include
                                    dependence on the quality and scope of the training data and the inherent inability
                                    of AI to fully replace medical professionals.</li>
                                <li>All project resources, including Python scripts, HTML/CSS code, and checkpoints, are
                                    provided to facilitate further development and experimentation. The system is
                                    intended to complement medical expertise and empower users to actively participate
                                    in their healthcare journey. Feedback and contributions are welcomed to enhance
                                    model accuracy and the overall effectiveness of the application, promoting early
                                    detection and improved healthcare accessibility.</li>

                                <li>LunaCLI is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for managing PostgreSQL
                                databases efficiently. It provides users with the ability to connect to databases,
                                execute SQL commands, and configure connection settings dynamically. The tool is ideal
                                for developers, database administrators, and power users who prefer a lightweight,
                                terminal-based interface for database operations.</li>

                                <li>LunaCLI allows users to connect to PostgreSQL databases using custom credentials, modify
                                connection parameters such as username, password, database name, and port, and execute
                                SQL queries directly from the CLI. It supports a wide range of database operations,
                                including transactions, table management, schema creation, stored procedures, and
                                multiple query execution, with results displayed in an organized table format.</li>

                                <li>Key features include history tracking, scheduling queries, executing SQL files,
                                exporting table data to CSV, saving frequently used SQL commands as snippets, and
                                retrieving results sequentially for batch operations. Prometheus support is included for
                                query monitoring, enabling users to track database performance metrics. Additionally,
                                LunaCLI supports cloning user entities and dynamic port configuration, providing
                                flexibility for diverse development and testing scenarios.</li>
